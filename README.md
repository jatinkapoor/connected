## Connected

A lot of seniors and vulnerable adults live alone. In addition, the number of single people is on the rise in the United States. There are times when people that live alone experience emergencies when they’re by themselves and aren’t able to call 911 for help. If they experience an emergency situation they may not be found for days or weeks.

This app provides a way for people to join groups and easily check-in daily so others in their network can rest assured that they’re ok. It also provides people with a way to alert people in their network that they’re going out of town for a few days or taking a vacation so that others don’t worry that they haven’t checked in for a few days.

If someone hasn’t checked in for a few days, others in their network are notified and can contact the authorities or go to the person’s house to check on them and make sure they’re ok. This app also displays a list of people who have and have not checked in in the last 24 hours.

As an added bonus, users can chat with others in their network and post to the community wall to build relationships. Users can also chat directly with each other.

## Why is this app valuable?
